# 08 - ARC4NE Versioning, CI/CD, and Extensibility Strategy

This document outlines strategies for sustainable development, delivery, and future growth of ARC4NE, covering semantic versioning, Git branching, CI/CD, plugin architecture, and multi-environment support. [^1]

## 1. Semantic Versioning (SemVer) Strategy

Adherence to Semantic Versioning (SemVer 2.0.0) is crucial for managing releases and dependencies. [^1]

*   **Scope:** Versioning will apply independently to:
    *   **Overall ARC4NE System:** A top-level version representing the state of the integrated product.
    *   **API:** Versioned via URL path (e.g., `/api/v1`, `/api/v2`).
    *   **Agent:** `arc4ne-agent-vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `arc4ne-agent-v1.0.0`).
    *   **Core Backend/Frontend Modules/Libraries:** If developed as separately publishable packages (less likely for this monorepo structure initially, but good practice if components are extracted).
*   **Format:** `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.2.3`)
    *   **MAJOR (X):** Incremented for incompatible API changes or significant architectural shifts.
    *   **MINOR (Y):** Incremented for adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
    *   **PATCH (Z):** Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes.
*   **Changelog:** A `CHANGELOG.md` file will be maintained at the root of the repository, detailing changes for each release version. This helps users and developers understand the evolution of the system.
*   **Pre-releases:** Suffixes like `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc.1` can be used for pre-release versions (e.g., `1.0.0-beta.2`).
*   **Build Metadata:** Suffixes like `+build.123` can be used for build metadata (e.g., `1.0.0+git.sha.abcdef`).

## 2. Git Branching Model

A simple and effective branching model is key for collaboration and release management. [^1]

*   **Recommendation:** Trunk-Based Development (TBD) with Release Branches.
    *   **`main` (or `master`):** The primary development branch. This branch should always be in a state that could potentially be released (i.e., all tests passing). Developers merge feature branches into `main`.
    *   **Feature Branches:** Short-lived branches created from `main` for developing new features or fixing bugs (e.g., `feat/new-task-type`, `fix/agent-beacon-issue`).
        *   These are merged back into `main` via Pull Requests (PRs) / Merge Requests (MRs) after code review and passing CI checks.
    *   **Release Branches:** When `main` is ready for a new release (e.g., `v1.1.0`), a release branch is created from `main` (e.g., `release/v1.1.0`).
        *   This branch is used for final testing, stabilization, and critical bug fixes specific to the release. No new features are added here.
        *   Hotfixes on a release branch are merged back into `main` as well to ensure `main` always contains all fixes.
    *   **Tags:** Git tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0-rc1`) are used to mark specific commits as official releases on the release branches (or directly on `main` for simpler projects if not using dedicated release branches).
*   **Feature Flags:** Use feature flags (e.g., controlled by environment variables or a configuration service) to hide incomplete or experimental features in the `main` branch. This allows merging code frequently without exposing unfinished work to all users or environments.

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline

A robust CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery or Deployment) pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment process. Tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins can be used. [^1]

*   **Triggers:**
    *   On every push to `main`.
    *   On every push to feature branches (for PR checks).
    *   On creation of tags matching a release pattern (e.g., `v*.*.*`) on release branches.
*   **Pipeline Stages:**
    1.  **Lint & Format Check:**
        *   Run linters (e.g., ESLint for frontend, Pylint/Flake8/Black/Ruff for backend Python).
        *   Check code formatting (e.g., Prettier for frontend, Black for backend).
    2.  **Unit & Integration Tests:**
        *   Run unit tests for frontend (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library) and backend (e.g., pytest).
        *   Run integration tests (e.g., API contract tests, service interaction tests).
        *   Generate code coverage reports (e.g., Istanbul/nyc for JS/TS, coverage.py for Python). Enforce coverage thresholds.
    3.  **Security Scans:**
        *   Static Application Security Testing (SAST) (e.g., SonarQube, Snyk Code, Bandit for Python).
        *   Dependency vulnerability scanning (e.g., `npm audit`, `pip-audit`, Snyk Open Source, Dependabot).
        *   Container image scanning (e.g., Trivy, Clair).
    4.  **Build Docker Images:**
        *   Build Docker images for `arc4ne-api`, `arc4ne-webui`, and `arc4ne-proxy` (if custom Nginx image needed).
        *   Tag images appropriately (e.g., with Git SHA, branch name, release version).
    5.  **Push Docker Images:**
        *   Push tagged images to a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, AWS ECR, GitLab Container Registry).
    6.  **Deploy (Conditional):**
        *   **Staging/Testing Environment:** Automatically deploy from `main` branch (or after successful merge to `main`) to a staging environment.
        *   **Production Environment:** Deploy from release tags/branches. This can be manual (triggered by a person) or automatic after successful staging deployment and further approvals/tests.
        *   Deployment can involve updating Kubernetes manifests, running `docker-compose up -d` on a server, or using platform-specific deployment tools.
*   **Agent Builds (Separate Pipeline/Stage):** [^1]
    *   A dedicated pipeline or stage for cross-compiling/packaging the agent executables for different target platforms (Linux, Windows, ARM).
    *   This stage would also handle code signing of the agent binaries.
    *   Artifacts (agent executables, installers) are stored securely (e.g., in an artifact repository like Artifactory, Nexus, or S3).

## 4. Plugin/Extension System Design (Future - Phase 3)

A plugin system will allow extending ARC4NE's functionality without modifying its core codebase. [^1]

*   **Goal:** Enable third-party or custom integrations for new task types, telemetry processors, or notification systems. [^1]
*   **Potential Areas for Extension:** [^1]
    *   **Agent Task Modules:** Allow adding new types of tasks the agent can execute (e.g., interacting with specific software, custom data collection).
    *   **Backend Telemetry Processors/Enrichers:** Plugins that can process raw telemetry data, enrich it, or trigger actions based on it.
    *   **External Notification Hooks:** Send alerts or data to external systems (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty, SIEM).
    *   **Custom Analytics/Reporting Tools:** Integrate new ways to visualize or analyze collected data.
*   **Design Ideas & Considerations:** [^1]
    *   **Well-Defined Interfaces/APIs:** Define clear interfaces or abstract base classes that plugins must implement (e.g., a `TaskExecutor` interface for agent plugins, a `TelemetryHandler` interface for backend plugins).
    *   **Discovery Mechanism:** How the core system finds and loads available plugins (e.g., scanning a specific directory, Python entry points via `setuptools`, configuration-based loading).
    *   **Sandboxing & Security:** Plugins execute code within the ARC4NE system. Security is paramount. Consider:
        *   Permission models for plugins (what resources can they access?).
        *   Sandboxing environments for plugin execution (especially for agent-side plugins).
        *   Code signing or vetting process for trusted plugins.
    *   **Lifecycle Management:** How plugins are installed, enabled, disabled, updated, and uninstalled.
    *   **Configuration:** Mechanism for users to configure individual plugins.
    *   **Language:** For backend plugins, Python would be natural. For agent plugins, it depends on the agent's language.

## 5. Multi-Environment Support (Dev/Test/Prod)

Managing configurations for different deployment environments is essential. [^1]

*   **Configuration Source:** Primarily through Environment Variables. This aligns with Docker and Kubernetes best practices (12-factor app principles). [^1]
*   **Configuration Files:**
    *   **Local Development (`.env`):** A `.env` file at the project root (gitignored) for local Docker Compose setups.
    *   **`docker-compose.override.yml`:** Can be used for local development customizations without altering the base `docker-compose.yml`. [^1]
    *   **Production/Staging:** No `.env` files. Configuration is injected by the orchestration platform (Kubernetes ConfigMaps/Secrets, Docker Swarm configs/secrets).
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Each environment should have its own: [^1]
    *   Database instances and credentials.
    *   API keys and secrets (e.g., JWT secret key).
    *   Feature flag settings.
    *   Logging levels and destinations.
    *   External service endpoints (if any).
*   **Runtime Configuration:** Prefer configuring the application at runtime via environment variables rather than baking environment-specific settings into Docker images. This makes images more portable across environments. [^1]
*   **Build-time Configuration (Frontend):** For frontend applications, `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixed environment variables are baked in at build time by Next.js. Ensure the CI/CD pipeline uses the correct environment variables for each target environment build.

This comprehensive strategy for versioning, CI/CD, extensibility, and environment management will support ARC4NE's development lifecycle and its evolution into a robust and maintainable system.
